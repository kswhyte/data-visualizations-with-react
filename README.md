#Data Visualizations with React

This mini app follows a [tutorial](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/data-visualization-with-react.html) from Turing: School of Design's Front-End Curriculum. Users are able to select a minimum, maximum, and current value for their "progress bar", which is an svg. By modifying these values, the svg reflects these changes by providing a live visual update. You are also able to select a color from a color input field/wheel for added customizaiton.
